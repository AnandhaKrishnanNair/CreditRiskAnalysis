# CreditRiskAnalysis

  Data collection: Gathering relevant data sources such as borrower information, credit histories, financial statements, and economic indicators.
  
  Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
  
  Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to gain insights into borrower characteristics, credit trends, risk factors, and potential relationships between variables.
  
  Model development: Building predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks to assess credit risk.
  
  Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
  
  Model deployment: Deploying the models into production environments for real-time credit risk assessment and decision-making.
